# Summary of "Tidy first?" by Kent Beck

The latest book of [the inventor of test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck) 
is the first one in the upcoming cycle of 3 books about software design. 
The cycle is supposed to help us, the readers, answer the question
which is to this day controversial among software engineers: "When to do the design?".

Kent draws a line between a "speculative design" - do the design first - and a "reactive design" - design as little
as possible, focus on the features and the design will emerge. 

On the system scale, the speculative design would be known as a big design up front.
Let the most skilled people, architects, do the design first, and then the less skilled developers can just implement it. 
The alternative would be the "evolutionary design", the idea that good design will emerge when we start implementing the features. 
Taken to the extreme, it will have the effects eloquently [described by Martin Fowler](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/designDead.html):

> In its common usage, evolutionary design is a disaster. The design ends up being the aggregation of a bunch of ad-hoc 
> tactical decisions, each of which makes the code harder to alter. In many ways you might argue this is no design, 
> certainly it usually leads to a poor design.

Kent's answer to the question "when?" is unsurprisingly "somewhere in the middle" of the speculative/reactive spectrum.
And the planned cycle of books is supposed to help us navigate where exactly. "Tidy first?" focuses on the smallest scale,
individual contributor, and the minutes to hours of their work. Two other books will address this question on the higher
levels: collaboration within a team of developers within days or weeks, and finally collaboration between engineers and
business people building a product within weeks, months and years.

So let's jump into the details, the book has 3 main sections, that answer the following questions:
"what?", "when?" and "why?".

## What? A catalog of tidyings.

Kent presents a collection of 15 tidyings - small-scale refactorings - changes of code structure without changing the observable behavior.
For an experienced designer, it's something they would probably already know and use. Nevertheless, it's worth going over the presented tidyings 
to consolidate your knowledge. The descriptions of the tidying also give some rationale behind them
that can be used as an argument during a code review.

To give you a foretaste of what kind of tidyings we're talking about, I'll present two: "guard clauses" 
and "new interface, old implementation".

### Guard clauses

It's easiest to show with an example. The following code calculates a discount if it's applicable:

```kotlin
fun calculateDiscount(): Double {
    if (condition) {
        /* multiple lines of calculation logic */
        return calculatedDiscount
    } else {
        return 0.0
    }
}
```

It should be converted to:

```kotlin
fun calculateDiscount(): Double {
    if (!condition) {
        return 0.0
    }
    
    /* multiple lines of calculation logic */
    return calculatedDiscount
}
```

This is an example that I found interesting because it reminded me of a discussion I had with one of my peers
when reviewing a pull request recently. If only I had read this book earlier, I could have appealed to Kent's authority
in my comment. But putting authority aside, Kent's arguments for this change is pretty simple, and I second that 100%:

> Code with guard clauses is easier to analyze because the preconditions are explicit.

### New interface, old implementation

This is a nice tidying I had an opportunity to use recently when implementing a new feature in the product I work on.
Without going into irrelevant details, I knew we had to support several serialization methods for the same data. 
Ideal candidate for polymorphism with a single interface and multiple implementations, isn't it?

But before creating a second implementation, I applied this tidying. I've created a new class, with the API I wanted for 
the new interface, and delegated calls to the old implementation. This was a single step, very quick and risk-free.
Now I could either immediately create the second implementation, or clean all the remaining usages of the old interface
and ditch it completely.

Importantly, it's this small tidying step, that opened both these possibilities to me.

## When? Tidy first, or maybe never?

For the question "when to tidy?" we can choose from the following options:
* never
* later - some day in the future
* after - immediately after implementing a behavior change
* first - before implementing a behavior change

The answer to this question is obviously "it depends", but Kent gives us some useful heuristics.

We should always tidy first, if we know that: 
`cost of tidying + cost of change after tidying < cost of change without tidying`
Of course, we will never know for sure, so we need to trust our guts here. On the other hand, when we're sure we will never touch specific code
again and we will not learn anything from tidying, let's not tidy at all.

When we consider choosing between tidying after or later, it's important to understand whether postponing tidying for later
will make it much more expensive. It might be the case when we forget what we want to tidy after some time. In that case, it's 
better to tidy directly after implementing behavior change.

Anyway, tidying first is usually the most appropriate choice, but we should avoid tidying just for the sake of tidying.
Still, we must consider our well-being beyond the cold ROI calculation - the joy that comes from tidying cannot be neglected.

### Bonus advice: tidying vs code review

One additional piece of advice I remembered from this part of the book is the recommendation to separate behavior changes from 
structural changes when putting our code to review. Kent described the dynamics of small vs big reviews I've (frustratingly) experienced
multiple times during my career. Small PRs are a burden to create, generate noise for reviewers and effectively slow you down. 
Big PRs are harder to review and slow reviewers down, effectively slowing you down. If we create a separate PR for our tidying,
then it's easier to review as it's supposed to not change the behavior. Also, a separate PR exclusively for behavior changes, it's easier to review
due to less noise. So if we're working in an environment that has a code review process in place, we can make it more effective this way.

On the side, Kent promised to provide some alternative solutions for the PR dynamics in further books of the series, 
I have a feeling it might be [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/), but we'll see. 

## Why? Economics of tidying.

For me, it was the most interesting and novel part of the book. Kent draws an analogy between tidying (or to put it broadly - design) 
and investments (as in investment finance). Time spent on tidying is analogous to money spent. Feature added
to the software (behavior change) is analogous to money earned.

With the above way of looking at the problem, and an assumption that "a dollar today > a dollar tomorrow", the investment
in solely structural changes seems irrational. Especially, if we consider an important aspect of both software and finance, which
is uncertainty. The investment made in the design today might pay off tomorrow, but it will be irrelevant if your company goes
down in the meantime.

For me, as an avid code cleaner, this conclusion is devastating. But fortunately, there's hope. The first argument for tidying 
was already mentioned. If the ROI is certain and immediate (with tidying the behavior change will be implemented faster) then we should tidy.
For the second argument, we need to understand the concept of options (yes, options like the ones you receive when joining a startup).
Kent describes the concept of options vividly:

>If you haven’t encountered financial options before, here is my quick primer.
>
>Start out with a thing with a price. A potato for a dollar. I have a dollar. You have a potato. I give you the dollar. You give me the potato. Now I have a potato, but I don’t have the dollar. You have the dollar, but you don’t have the potato anymore.
>
>Maybe I don’t want the potato now; I want it tomorrow. I’m sure will I want it tomorrow. I can give you a dollar today in return for your promise of a potato tomorrow. Tomorrow you deliver the potato, and we’re both happy. I’ll give you a little less than a dollar today, because of the time value of money.
>
>What if I’m not sure if I want the potato tomorrow? I might have a picnic if the weather is good, in which case I’ll make potato salad. If the weather is bad, though, I don’t want to have bought a potato that will go to waste. In this case I can buy your promise of a potato tomorrow for a dollar tomorrow, but I might not hold you to that promise.

So an option is a promise. I might buy something from you for a given price, and you promise to have it available for me. Such
an option has value in itself. That's why options cost money. Getting back to the world of software design, it's good to have
an option to quickly implement a behavioral change should a market opportunity occur. The time window of a market opportunity can be short. 
Good design makes a product more adaptable to the changing environment. And the more volatile the environment is, the more valuable
are the options that come from the good design.

I must admit that I enjoyed this part of the book very much. After the lecture, I will probably tidy a little less now than I used to. 
Or, to put it differently, I'll give a little bit more attention to assess if I should follow my instinct considering the broader picture. 
As the scope of your responsibility grows and you start to be responsible not only for your work but also for the work of others, 
the stakes get even higher, but it makes the dilemmas even more interesting.

### Extra takes to remember.

Just a couple of last points from this part of the book I want to note for myself in the future:

* Structure changes are usually reversible, behavior changes usually aren't. That's why we should be more careful with behavior changes,
 including analysis, design, code review.

* Constantine's equivalence: ```cost of software ~= cost of change ~= cost of big changes ~= cost of coupling```, a nice explanation is provided in the book,
 I won't spoil everything here ;)

* Coupling is inevitable. It always exists in relation to a specific type of change. For one type of change, modules can be coupled, 
 while for another type of change, they might be decoupled. Decoupling in the context of one change can increase the coupling in the context
 of another change. We should minimize coupling for the changes that have the highest probability of occurring.

* Cohesion - keep coupled things together. Be careful, as your information on understanding can be incomplete.
