Hi! Iâ€™m Hubert, a software craftsman, product engineer, problem solver and family man based in Warsaw, Poland.

I've been considering having a programming blog for some time now. I think the first time I got this idea was 
after reading the [Software Craftsman](https://www.goodreads.com/pl/book/show/23215733) book 6 or 7 years ago. 
At that time I was still early in my career though and thought that I did not have anything interesting to share.
Over time I learned more and more, I got some ideas for blog posts, but somehow never got to the point of actually 
writing anything. Even though I negotiated a 4-day workweek when joining my current company, especially to start
building some kind of personal brand, I still haven't written anything on my free Fridays.

I was trying to figure out why it's like so, and I think I know now. I'd blame a mixture of perfectionism and 
an impostor syndrome I struggle with. You know, the people I work with have always appreciated me, I've received 
a lot of praise and should feel the satisfaction from the work I do. But for some reason, it was never enough.
I've always wanted to leave an impactful idea behind me, to somehow change the field of software engineering. 
But the vision of how much it would take paralyzed me and all the "great ideas" I wanted to share seemed not that great. 
I was also afraid of failure, I guess.

But now I'm starting the blog, so what changed? What is the impulse that helped me overcome the emotions I have been
struggling with for years? There's no single reason, I can think of three main. 

Firstly, I'm leaving my current company and started looking for a new job.
 I feel I need some platform on which I can let potential employers and colleagues 
get to know me, and the universal formula of a resume and sometimes a cover letter doesn't seem sufficient. I feel
it is fundamentally one-dimensional as it focuses on successes and achievements, while our failures play an equally
important role in shaping who we are. 

Secondly, I noticed some symptoms of burnout in myself. I was always an avid code cleaner, I honestly enjoyed refactoring
just for the sake of it. I felt extreme satisfaction when deleting dead code. Even before Covid, when I could code only at 
the workstation in the office, I used to spend hours after work thinking about how to evolve the architecture of the products 
I worked on, whether I was walking the dog, taking a shower or falling asleep. I did it as it simply gave me joy. 
But I believe you need to put yourself a limit for such endeavors, to still be hungry when you're at work.
Maybe someday, I'll write more about it, so that I can prevent someone from entering this path. But realistically,
I'm afraid, that such testimony would not be enough anyway. I remember listening to a podcast a long time ago, where Maciej Aniserowicz 
([devstyle.pl](https://devstyle.pl/)) talked exactly about this subject. Somehow, I was always sure "it won't happen to me",
but I was wrong. Fortunately, I still have the energy and drive to explore the vast world of software engineering. I'm still curious and 
I still want to learn and grow. With the blog, I hope to convert this energy into something tangible, so when I feel the urge to 
work after work, I can invest it here.

The final and direct reason for this blog though is... Black Friday. Let me give some context. I've always enjoyed reading books. 
But my problem with books, especially with novels, but also with technical ones, is that I quickly forget what I read about. 
I mean, I usually remember the main ideas or the impression a book made on me, but in terms of remembering the plot or the details, 
here is worse. But how does it relate to the Black Friday? Well, I've used a Black Friday discount and invested in access to 
[O'Reilly learning platform](https://www.oreilly.com/). I plan to use it extensively for the next year and wanted to have a notebook
from this experience. I would like to review and summarize the books I read so that I can get back to them in the future.
Why not publish it as a blog then? 

I intentionally don't put high expectations on myself. I'm writing mostly for my future self, but if the content I publish is valuable to others, 
then wonderful. As I write the content for myself, the pressure for the content to be perfect is relieved. 
This blog may end after a couple of posts, it may live longer. The future will show.
